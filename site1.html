<h2>Introduction to Cultural Diversity</h2>  


<p id="firsttest">Cultural diversity is what makes our world unique and vibrant. It refers to the many different traditions, languages, foods, and ways of life that people follow across the globe. Understanding and appreciating different cultures helps bring people together, fostering respect and acceptance.
</p>

<h2>How Culture Shapes Identity</h2>

<p id="buttontest">Culture influences who we are and how we see the world. It affects the way we speak, celebrate, eat, and interact with others. For example, festivals like Diwali in India, Carnival in Brazil, or Thanksgiving in the U.S. all reflect the values and histories of those communities. The food we eat, the music we enjoy, and the traditions we follow all help shape our identity.
